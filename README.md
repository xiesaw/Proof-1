This short code imports the pygame library and uses it to create a background and a ball. (Incomplete, but the end result will be a game where opposing players battle it out through a turn based aiming game, similar to that of air hockey or golf. They aim to score on their opponents through a randomly generated map littered with obstacles.)

It uses functions for the behaviour of in game objects; object oriented programming for sprites such as the ball, players and obstacles; loops and booleans to run the game; and conditionals for event handling such as bouncing off walls or objects.
